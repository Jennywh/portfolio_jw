    <p class="paragraph">📅 <strong>Year</strong>: 2021 Fall<br>⚡️ <strong>Contributions</strong>: Full-stack UX/UI Design, User Research, Task Analysis, Prototyping, Usability Testing, Visual Design<br>💻 <strong>Software</strong>: Figma, Miro <br>In four months, we worked with Fiserv, a FinTech company, and designed a mobile app that incorporates Bitcoin into traditional online banking platforms, making digital currencies transactions seamless and elegant. </p>
    <div>
      <p class="subtitle"><strong class="bold-text-5">01 | For What, You May Wonder</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">As you may have noticed, cryptocurrencies have become a popular investment for the average individual. We want to explore the possibilities of implementing Bitcoin with the traditional online banking platform by studying current cryptocurrency holders&#x27; perceptions of this emerging <strong class="btc-emphasis">digital currency</strong>. We want to identify the wants and needs of these Bitcoin holders to understand their perceptions of this emerging digital currency and improve upon the existing online banking system, facilitating <strong class="btc-emphasis">cryptocurrency transactions</strong>. </p>

      <p class="subtitle"><strong>02 | User Research &amp; Insights</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">We found that cryptocurrency investors are of a variety of different age groups, ethnicities, and locations but are primarily of high-income households. According to research conducted by the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, the average household income for Bitcoin owners is $110k. So we chose to focus on holders with a household annual income over $75k because this group is representative of this population. <strong class="sub-header"></strong>‍<br></p>
      <p class="sub-header"><strong class="sub-header">Research Methods </strong>‍<br></p>
      <ol role="list">
        <li class="paragraph">Survey <br><strong>‍</strong>We want to use surveys to validate two things. 1. Bitcoin owners have family incomes ranging from $75k to $200k. 2. Bitcoin is the most widely used cryptocurrency to date. Our survey data confirmed both. We used this data to narrow down our target audience.  <br>‍<br></li>
        <li class="paragraph">Interview <br>The surveys helped us narrow down our problem space and played a large role in generating the topics and questions for our interviews. We used the <strong class="btc-emphasis">open-ended </strong>nature of interviews to get a big picture of the Bitcoin market and different perspectives.</li>

      <p class="subtitle"><strong>05 | Usability Testing</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">We conducted think-aloud usability testing. Alongside the user testing, we had two HCI professors - Dr. Bruce and Dr. Walker to provide heuristic evaluations feedback. I present our key findings below. <br></p>
      <p class="paragraph centered"><strong class="bold-text-8">💪</strong></p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li class="paragraph"><strong>Strength #1: Design Consistency and Aesthetics <br>‍</strong>Our components and visual design are consistent throughout the entire flow. We created a visual design style guide before starting the actual high-fidelity prototype. Consistency in the system design reduces users learning curves as it is simplistic. </li>
        <li class="paragraph"><strong>Strength #2: Visibility of System Status <br>‍</strong>Users understand where they are despite having many pages and functionalities. When interacting with the system, such as creating a new account, users get clear feedback on their progress and the result</li>
        <li class="paragraph"><strong>Strength #3: Match Current Banking App Systems<br>‍</strong>Our system architecture matches the current trending mobile banking apps. It takes less to no effort for new users to navigate different pages. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paragraph centered"><strong class="bold-text-8">🤡</strong></p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li class="paragraph"><strong>Weakness #1: External Account<br></strong>Users were confused about whether they could make changes to their external accounts from the banking app. If it is read-only, what is the purpose of linking the accounts? </li>
        <li class="paragraph"><strong>Weakness #2: Portfolio Return Alert<br></strong>The &quot;portfolio return alert&quot; was confusing to most users. Most participants were not sure when the alert would be activated, or how they are activated. </li>
        <li class="paragraph"><strong>Weakness #3: Bitcoin Account <br></strong>Most users were unsure how to use the Bitcoin account. For instance, how could they make a transaction or purchase items? We need to put more specific information on this either before or after they created an account. </li>

      <p class="subtitle"><strong>06 | Retrospective</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">In this process, I learned not to be arrogant with my design ideas but to allow the users&#x27; feedback to be provocative. Reflecting on users&#x27; nonverbal reactions/feedback is important for iterative design and to better the interview. When a user takes a long time to respond to an interview question, it might not be a clear question, or the interview isn&#x27;t structured in a way such that it gives users a chance to refresh their memories. <br><br>On a broader scope, I would criticize our design process for missing the value of inclusion and equity. We focused solely on Bitcoin users, who are a group of people that have enough financial stability to make risky investments. This is confirmed by our interviewees&#x27; demographics - all were at least college educated and 90% male. In other words, this is not a value-sensitive design. <br><br>Unfortunately, I think this problem is prevalent in most design projects. Because we, students earning a master&#x27;s degree in product design at Georgia Tech, are limited in our life experiences and our connections. People live in their bubbles, and we are a bubble of technology-prone, college-degree-earned, financially-sufficient people trying to design a product UI that attracts a similar crowd. <br><br>We could&#x27;ve explored more on those who don&#x27;t own Bitcoin but want to learn about Blockchain, those that can&#x27;t afford to make risky investments but wish our product help them find alternatives. Those are missing. <br></p>
