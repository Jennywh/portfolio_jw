      <p class="paragraph">As an international student myself, I feel the pride, the privilege, as well as the loneliness, the isolation altogether. I saw the need for an online community for Chinese international students in the US. Hence, in 2022, I started this CIRCLE online community project.<br>‚Äç<br>Studies show that college students frequently suffer from mental disorders such as depression (41.6%) and anxiety (36.4%). The lack of social support and cultural differences make it even worse for international students. A welcoming, close-knit community could be their lifebuoy ring to thrive academically and mentally. I realize that international students tend to be scattered in different locations, only an online community can conquer the distance.<strong class="sub-header"> <br>‚Äç</strong>‚Äç</p>

      <p class="subtitle"><strong class="bold-text-5">02 | Competitive Analysis </strong></p>
      <ul role="list" class="list">
        <li><strong>1point3acres<br></strong>This is the most frequently used site for Chinese international students to look for resources. Information exists in forum posts format. Users cannot edit their original posts or delete their posts. Searching within the site needs points, which have been made increasingly hard to earn. This mechanism is designed to keep users active daily. However, the overall information transparency on this site is low, as users cannot access posts freely and do not have control of their posted content. Subscription to the site costs 41.67 dollars per month.</li>
        <li><strong>moonbbs</strong><br>This site focuses on shopping in the U.S. for Chinese people. It does not provide any resource for student-oriented information. It uses a basic BBS(bulletin board system) format.</li>
        <li><strong>xiakexing</strong><br>This site only focuses on how to succeed in tech interviews. Users can only interact below each posts thread. Visitors cannot access posts without an account. The format is also basic BBS.</li>
        <li><strong>1o24bbs<br></strong>This site is also targeting people who are job hunting. Under the life in the US section, the majority of posts are about stocks and finance.</li>
        <li><strong>uscardforum</strong><br>This site is only targeting people who need financial advice or American credit cards. It mostly shares information on how to apply for credit cards, how to build up credit scores, and how to use credit cards strategically.</li>
        <li><strong>Wechat groups</strong><br>WeChat groups create private environments. Outsiders only join when a member invites you with a QR code. I am currently in three Georgia Tech students&#x27; WeChat groups. It‚Äôs similar to iMessage groups. No information is accessible on the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>GT Discord server<br></strong>This server is under the GT student hub on Discord, which can be accessed with a GT email. The threads in this server are oriented around CS classes, and students usually organize/find WeChat groups through this discord server. Overall, it‚Äôs not an active community.<br>‚Äç</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>TL;DR: </strong>The majority of those sites focus on helping Chinese international students with job hunting in the tech industry, shopping, and finance. The Bulletin board system platform makes it hard for users to build personal connections or meet people locally. Wechat groups, in comparison, are a more coherent community and exist across all American universities. However, they are not searchable on the internet, and information gets lost easily as chats overflow. All three GT WeChat groups I have access to have roughly 470 people (500 is the maximum number).</p>

      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Usability Testing <br></strong>I conducted a think-aloud task walkthrough with a low-fidelity mockup to facilitate the iterative design process. I¬†was able to identify confusion with wording, mismatch between users&#x27; mental models, and categorization. I¬†also did preference testing on different versions of the menu bar. After 4 interviews, data reached saturation with repetitive feedback. <br></p>

        <p class="paragraph">The CIRCLE online community project was born from both personal experience and empirical evidence, recognizing the unique challenges Chinese international students face in the US. By targeting the poignant issues of loneliness, depression (41.6%), and anxiety (36.4%), this platform serves as a crucial support system.<strong><br>Addressing a Real Need:</strong> The emotional struggles of international students are not just anecdotal but supported by research, underlining the real necessity of this platform.<br>‚Äç<strong>Conquering Distance:</strong> The online format unites students scattered across different locations, bridging the geographical gap and providing a communal environment.<br>‚Äç<strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> CIRCLE not only addresses mental health issues but also fosters a community that respects and celebrates cultural diversity.<br>‚Äç<strong>Personal Investment:</strong> As an international student myself, this project is not just a technical endeavor but a personal mission to provide others with the support I&#x27;ve felt they need.<br><br>In conclusion, CIRCLE stands as a testament to the power of community, the significance of empathy in design, and the necessity of culturally sensitive innovation. It is more than a platform; it&#x27;s a lifebuoy ring for those navigating the turbulent waters of studying abroad.</p>
